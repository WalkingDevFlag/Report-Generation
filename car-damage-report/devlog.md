# Development Log: Car Damage Report Generation

## Overview
This development log outlines the process and updates made to generate a comprehensive Car Damage Report. The report summarizes the dents and scratches identified on a vehicle, detailing the classification of damage, the area affected, and visual documentation.

## Initial Data Collection
The data was collected in a structured format as follows:

```
Class ID,Damage Type,Area
0,Dent,1500
0,Dent,1800
0,Dent,1600
0,Dent,1400
0,Dent,1300
1,Scratch,1200
1,Scratch,900
1,Scratch,2000
1,Scratch,1100
1,Scratch,950
```

### Functionality Requirements
We needed to create a function that:
- Counts the number of instances of each damage type (Dents and Scratches).
- Formats the output according to a predefined template.

### Template Structure
The initial template for the report was defined as:

```
Damage Breakdown:
• Class ID [Class ID]: [Damage Type]
• Number of Instances: [Number of Instances]
• Mask Areas:
• [Damage Type] [Instance Number]: [Area]
```

## Progress Updates

### Report Generation
After implementing the initial functionality, the report output was generated as follows:

```
Car Damage Report
Introduction:
This report provides an overview of the dents and scratches identified on the vehicle. The analysis includes the classification of damage, the area affected, and visual documentation of the damages.
Damage Breakdown:
• Class ID 0: Dent
• Number of Instances: 5
• Mask Areas:
  • Dent 1: 1500 sq. mm
  • Dent 2: 1800 sq. mm
  • Dent 3: 1600 sq. mm
  • Dent 4: 1400 sq. mm
  • Dent 5: 1300 sq. mm

• Class ID 1: Scratch
• Number of Instances: 5
• Mask Areas:
  • Scratch 6: 1200 sq. mm
  • Scratch 7: 900 sq. mm
  • Scratch 8: 2000 sq. mm
  • Scratch 9: 1100 sq. mm
  • Scratch 10: 950 sq. mm
```

### Formatting Improvements
To enhance the report's readability and presentation:
- Adjusted font to Calibri (body), size 12pt.
- Implemented line spacing to create sufficient distance between each Class ID section.
- Ensured bullet points were formatted correctly using `[Shift]+[Enter]` for line breaks.

### Instance Number Resetting 
To improve clarity in reporting:
- Modified the instance numbering for each damage type to start from `1` for each category (Dents and Scratches) rather than continuing from previous counts.

### Final Report Structure 
The final version of the report appeared as follows:

```
Car Damage Report
Introduction:
This report provides an overview of the dents and scratches identified on the vehicle. The analysis includes the classification of damage, the area affected, and visual documentation of the damages.
Damage Breakdown:
• Class ID 0: Dent
  Number of Instances: 5
  Mask Areas:
    Dent 1: 1500 sq. mm
    Dent 2: 1800 sq. mm
    Dent 3: 1600 sq. mm
    Dent 4: 1400 sq. mm
    Dent 5: 1300 sq. mm


• Class ID 1: Scratch
  Number of Instances: 5
  Mask Areas:
    Scratch 1: 1200 sq. mm
    Scratch 2: 900 sq. mm
    Scratch 3: 2000 sq. mm
    Scratch 4: 1100 sq. mm
    Scratch 5: 950 sq. mm
```

### Additional Formatting Changes 
To further enhance visibility:
- Made "Damage Breakdown:" bold and increased its font size to `14pt`.

## Conclusion 
The Car Damage Report generation process has been successfully implemented with clear formatting and structured data presentation. Future updates may include additional damage types or enhanced visual elements for better reporting clarity.
